## Getting Started

To use this template, you should first create another repository that will serve as your project's repo. Once you have it created, you can clone this template and your project's repo to your local disk.

Once you have both repositories cloned, you need to copy the entire contents of the nextjs-tailwind-template into the other project's folder on your local disk. 

Now, navigate to your project's root directory and follow this guide: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git
